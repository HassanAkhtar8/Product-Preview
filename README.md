## Overview

This is a solution to the [Product preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Links

- Live Site URL: [live site URL](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

- First I designed the big screen size and then added media querry for small screen size
- I created a main div and added two divs inside it one as img-container and other as conten-container 
- Then I used flex to adjust them and cutomised the layout accordingly
- Same was done in media querry but not everything was changed

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- I used media querry for the first time in my project
- I learned to add icons
- I learned the inherent properties of divs and child


### Continued development

- I would learn more about flexbox 
- Learn and use responsive designs in my projects
